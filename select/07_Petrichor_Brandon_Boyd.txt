Why does this always happen?
You and I come undone
Watching the ask on your cigarette
Steady hand, and the muted sun
The clouds crowding are gonna get us wet
Stay here don't run

Rain
Comes
Senses fade
Petrichor
Wash away all your
Pain
From
Heart and head
Give me more
Bravo, encore

Here it comes again
And there it goes
Here it comes again

You were covered in ashes
I was covered in dust
Ever awaken our epithets
Come on it's just

Rain
Here it comes again
And there it goes
Here it comes, here it comes

Rain
Comes
Senses fade
Petrichor
Wash away all your
Pain
From
Heart and head
Give me more
Bravo, encore

Here it comes again
And there it goes Here it comes again
