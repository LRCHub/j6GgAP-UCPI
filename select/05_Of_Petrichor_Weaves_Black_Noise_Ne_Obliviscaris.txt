Swan of pale of porcelain white
Her halo, a bloody sun
Framing a Botticelli face
Of petrichor weaves black noise
Where her frame disfigures
Pale of the swan, painted, dying
Wilting in red ribbons
Lashing black sails, a tattered mane
Her mouth, a death's head smile
Tongueless choirs and baited breath
Ever watching the angels beheaded
Bleeding this heart, come clarity resonance
Of petrichor weaves black noise
Light draped, ephemeral
Her stain glass horizon
The houseglass shattered
Glacial starfell memories caligari haunting
Within this cabinet of change
Upon flutter eye wings
In efflorescence, the shadows' sarabande
And silence was her name, the silence so loud
Time, cleanse these severed hands of time
Rain, rain again wash away this pain
On moonkissed flesh
New kingdom come of earthen vast libera me
Rain, rain, earthen shine, shine
New kingdom, shine shine on
Dreamer, I dream on, dream
Dream, follow me afar
Weep, come, kingdom come (Oh) hope
Libera me libera me
Libera me libera me
Libera me
