And oh, oh, oh, oh
And the rain came down and washed it all away
And oh, oh, oh, oh
And the rain came down and washed it all away
The time is here
The day is new
We'll find a way back home

And oh, oh, oh, oh
And the rain came down and washed it all away
And oh, oh, oh, oh
And the rain came down and washed it all away

We'll find a way back home
Home
Home

The clouds will open and the seas will rise
The ladders will come down from the skies
The glaciers will melt and the trees will fall
The trees will fall

There's no more future and no more past
We'll be on our way back home at last

And the rain
And the rain came down
And the rain came down

And the rain
And the rain
And the rain came down
And the rain came down
