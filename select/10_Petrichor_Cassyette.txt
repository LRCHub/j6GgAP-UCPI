I wanna be reborn
Petrichor on the floor of your mind
I’m sorry for this pain I caused
The rain I left behind
Petrichor we’re left paralysed
A battlefield A vortex we’re shattered from the fight
I’ve got an ache in my heart
Can’t fix this hole in my HEAD
Didn’t think we could restart
Maybe we’re better off DEAD
Dead in the water
Cos we ain’t like we were before yeah
Lock up your sons and daughters
There’s no one left to trust no more
I’m caught in your spiral
Can’t find the cure
Ready for revival
I wanna be reborn
It’s suffocating living in regret
Medicate me til there’s nothing left
A perfect storm for suicide
A look into the other side
Tear me apart and il paint the walls red
I’ve got an ache in my heart
Can’t fix this hole in my heart
Didn’t think we could restart
Maybe we’re better off DEAD
Dead in the water
Cos we ain’t like we were before yeah
Lock up your sons and daughters
There’s no one left to trust no more
I’m caught in your spiral
Can’t find the cure
Ready for revival
I wanna be reborn
Wake up from your slumber at the gates of hell
Break the lock and burn down your cell
The earth is quiet but the mothers well
Internalise your healing
Eye of the storm we’ll let it pass
Pick up the pieces
Broken glass
Rain will fall but grow the grass
I wanna be reborn
Dead in the water
Cos we ain’t like we were before yeah
Lock up your sons and daughters
There’s no one left to trust no more
I’m caught in your spiral
GIVE MY PETRICHOR
Ready for revival
I wanna be reborn
