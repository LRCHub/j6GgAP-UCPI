Well, I didn't work today
Petrichor
The dust, the mud, the sweat
Washed up off the floor
And all is forgiven, all is replaced
This is the cherry lipstick smeared across your face
And it's not wrong, it's not wrong, it's not wrong
It's moving on
The second verse is in the song
All is forgiven
All is replaced
All is forgiven
All is replaced
And I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all again
Petrichor, petrichor, petrichor
Come feel it all again
Goodbye seems remiss of me to say
Everything potentially, always, always
We may be broken up
But kindness fades
And anyway, anyway
I did not let go
Forever tangled in the rope
We blame each other
That's just another way to cope
All is forgiven
All is replaced
I was ready again to love
And I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all again
Petrichor, petrichor, petrichor
Come feel it all again
I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all again
Petrichor, petrichor, petrichor
Come feel it all again
We may not meet again
Wrong way on the street again
You can find me in the deep again
Petrichor
We may not meet again
Wrong way on the street again
You can find me in the deep again
Petrichor, petrichor, petrichor
